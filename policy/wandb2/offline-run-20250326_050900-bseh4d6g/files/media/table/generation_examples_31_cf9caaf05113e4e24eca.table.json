And return the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer> (1 + 2) / 3 </answer>.\nassistant\nLet me solve this step by step.\n<think> We need to use the numbers [59, 59, 78] exactly once to get the result of 79 using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Let's try different combinations: </think>\n<think> First, let's see if we can subtract one number from another to get close to 79: </think>\n<think> If we subtract 59 from 78, we get -21. That's not useful yet. Let's try other combinations. </think>\n<think> Next, let's consider multiplying two numbers together: </think>\n<think> Multiplying 59 * 59 gives us 3481. That's too large. Let's try dividing: </think>\n<think> Dividing 59 by 78 gives us approximately 0.76. This is also not ideal. </think>\n<think> Now, let's try adding numbers: </think>\n<think> Adding 59 + 59 = 118, which is still far away from 79. Let's try another combination. </think>\n<think> Subtracting 59 from 59 gives us 0. This doesn't help either. Let's try dividing again: </think>\n<think> Dividing 59 by 78 results in approximately 0.76, which isn't optimal. </think>\n<think> Finally, let's add 59 + 59 and then divide by 78: </think>\n<think> (59 + 59) / 78 = 118 / 78 = 1.526... This is closer but not quite there. </think>\n<think", 0]]}
