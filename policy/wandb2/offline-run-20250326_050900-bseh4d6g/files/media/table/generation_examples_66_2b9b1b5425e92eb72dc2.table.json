Instead, let's think about adding/subtracting numbers that could lead us closer to 98 while using all three numbers.\n\nConsider this: What if we start from 92 and subtract smaller numbers? If we keep subtracting until we reach something close to 98?\nSubtracting 1 from 92 gives us 91. Then subtract 5 gives us 86. Subtracting 1 more brings us to 85. Adding 3 gets us to 88. Subtracting 2 finally gives us 90. Adding 8 completes the task:\n\n90 + 8 = 98\n\nSo now we have our equation:\n(92 - 1 - 5) + 1 - 5 + 1 - 1 - 5 + 1 + 8 = 98\n</think>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<think>(92 - 1 - 5) + 1 - 5 + 1 - 1 - 5 + 1 + 8 = 98", 0], ["system\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Let's start by considering how we might combine these numbers to get close to 79 without exceeding it.</think>\n\nWe notice that 59 is already close to our target of 79, so let's see if we can use division or subtraction to reach exactly 79.\n\n<think>\n- First, I'll try subtracting one of the smaller numbers from 59: \n  59 - 59 = 0\n\n- Now, adding 78 to zero gives us:\n  0 + 78 = 78\n\n- This gets us very close but not quite there. To make 79, we need an extra 1 more than what we have now.\n\n- Notice that if we add 1 to 78, we would exceed 79 because 78 + 1 = 79.\n</think>\n\nSo, let's think of another way:\n\n<think>\n- Instead of addition, consider subtraction again.\n- If we take away 1 from 59, we get:\n  59 - 1 = 58\n\n- Adding this back to 78 gives us:\n  78 + 58 = 136\n\n- This doesn't help us reach 79 either. Let's try another approach.\n\n- Consider multiplication instead of addition/subtraction initially:\n  59 * 59 = 3481\n\n- This is too large. We need something closer to 79.\n\n- Let's try dividing 59 by itself twice:\n  59/59 = 1\n\n- Then multiply by 59", 0]]}
