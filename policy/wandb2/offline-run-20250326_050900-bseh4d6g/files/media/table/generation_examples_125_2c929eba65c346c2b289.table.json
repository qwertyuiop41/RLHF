Let's try different combinations of operations. I'll start with multiplication since it often helps when reaching a specific target number. [71 x 25 = 1775] This is too high, so let's use subtraction instead. [1775 - 98 = 1677] Still too high. Now we have to use division or addition/subtraction to reach 88. Let\u2019s see if we can get close using multiplication again. [98 * 25 = 2450] This is also too high. Let\u2019s try combining some of these numbers: [2450 / 90 \u2248 27. 22] This is still not correct. It seems we might need another approach. Let\u2019s try adding and subtracting carefully: [71 \u2013 25 \u2013 25 + 98 = 17]. This doesn\u2019t give us exactly 88 either. Finally, let\u2019s consider a combination involving all four numbers: [25 x 71 = 1775] This is very close but slightly higher than our target. Subtracting from this gives us [1775 \u2013 90 = 1685] which is too high. Adding 25 gets us closer [1685 + 25 = 1710] But this is still over.

We would subtract 23 from 37, leaving us with 14. Now we just need one more number that adds up to 14. The only number left in the list that adds up to 14 is 77. But again, 77 isn\u2019t in the list.

Adding another number like 50 will give us a much larger sum. However, if we multiply 8 * 2 = 16 and then add 50, it doesn't quite reach 18.\n\nA better approach would be to use subtraction because it allows us to subtract one of our numbers from the others. If we subtract 24 from 50, we get 26, which is still too big. But if we try to divide 50 by 2 instead of multiplying, we can adjust later.\n\nLet's start by dividing 50 by 2: 50/2 = 25. Now we have 25 left after using 2 from 50. \n\nNext, let's take away 8 from 25: 25 - 8 = 17.

To get 20 from 114, we could subtract 78, but that would leave us with too much. Instead, let's try dividing 114 by 39/4 instead: 114 \u00f7 39/4 = 114 * 4/39 = 4*2 = 8. This gives us a total of 156 - 42 + 16 = 120. That\u2019s still not right. The key here was choosing the correct multiplication first. If we had chosen 39 x 4 directly, we would have gotten 156 as our starting point, which divided into 42 leaves us with a remainder of 18, leaving us far short of the target of 20.

We want to create an equation that equals 79.\nFirst, let's try using addition:\n[59 + 59 + 78 = 196]\nThis doesn't equal 79, so we'll move on to other options.\nNext, let's try subtraction:\n[78 - 59 - 59 = 0]\nThis also doesn't equal 79, so we'll try multiplication or division next.\nNow, let's try multiplication:\n[59 * 59 * 78 = 340676]\nThis still doesn't equal 79, so we'll try division:\n[59 / 59 * 78 = 2 x 78 = 156]\nThis is still not 79, so none of these combinations worked.\n\n</p>\n<answer> 78 + 59 - 59 = 79 </p> </p>  </p>  [Answer: (78 + 59) - 59 = 79 ] </p> [Think carefully about how you arrived at this answer. Make sure you understand it before answering.] <p />\n[Final Answer: The equation that equals 79 using the numbers [59, 59, 78] is 78 + 59 - 59. ]\n[Answer: 78 + 59 - 59 = 79 ] [Think carefully about how you arrived at this answer. Make sure you understand it before answering.] [Final Answer: The equation that equals", 0]]}
