The closest thing to 20 that we have is 42, so let's try taking away 8 from 39. That gives us -42, which isn't what we want.\nNext, let's try multiplying: We know that 4 x 5 = 20, but since we don't have any 4s or 5s in our list, let's try adding two more numbers together to get close to 20. How about 15 and 4? Adding those gives us 19, which is still not quite there.\nNow, let's try division: If we divide 39 by 3, we get 13, which is too low. But if we divide 42 by 3, we get 14, which is even lower than 13. This suggests that maybe we should add 4 to our original calculation instead of subtracting 4 as I initially thought.\nSo, combining all these ideas, here's the final equation:\n[39 - (15 * 4)] / 6 = 20\nThis works because:\n(39 - 60", 0], ["system\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Instead of adding them directly, let's multiply one of the larger numbers by another to make it more manageable before adding.\nMultiplying 56 by 2 gives us 112, which is way too high!

Let's add some of these smaller results together: 62 + 69 + 70 + 5 = 204, which is too much. Instead, let's subtract one of the larger numbers from our target sum: 100 - 31 = 69.

Since we don't have any specific operations like square roots or exponentiations mentioned, let's start with simple additions and subtractions:\n1. We know that adding two positive numbers will give us a larger sum than either number alone.\n2. Subtracting a smaller number from a larger one often gives a lower number, but if it\u2019s done correctly, it could lead to the desired result.\n\nLet's try subtracting the smallest number (2) from the largest (94):\n[94] - [2] = [92]\nNow our target is to reach 23, so we need to add something else to make up the difference between 23 and 92:\n92 + [?] = 23\n\nBut wait! We already have a number that doesn\u2019t match the required operation sequence. Let's reconsider how we can use all three numbers effectively:\n\nWe can do 48 - 2 = 46, which isn't quite right because we need 23 as the final answer. \n\nHowever, if we think carefully, we might consider combining numbers in different ways. For instance, if we had a multiplication instead of addition/subtraction, it could help:\n\nIf we multiply 48 by 2/94, we'll get close to 23. But again, we're not using all numbers properly yet.\n\nA better approach would be to see if there's a way to combine the numbers directly to reach the target:\n\nSince 23 is very close to 25, maybe multiplying by 2/94 and then rounding up (or down) could achieve this?\n\nLet", 0], ["system\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Since we have 3 as one of our numbers, let's see if we can use it in a way to reach 31. \nFirst, we could try adding 21 to 3 to get 24, which isn't quite there yet. But if we subtract 7 from 94, we get 87, which is still far off. However, if we subtract 7 from 21, we get -5, which doesn't help us get closer to 31.

One way is to use subtraction because it's easy to get close to 69 without reaching it exactly:\n78 - 66 = 12\nNow we need 57 more to make 69. So let's use division to get there:\n(69 - 12) / 57 = 69\nBut since we're not allowed to use the same number twice, we have to adjust. Instead of dividing 69 by 57, which would give us 1.206... and then subtracting 12 from that, we can do something similar but slightly different. Let's try:\n78 - (57 * (69 - 54)) = 69\nHere, we're multiplying 69 by 54 (which is just a small adjustment to reach 69), and then subtracting that product from 78. This gives us 69, as expected. Now let's break down what happened:\n- We multiplied 69 by 57 to get 3833\n- Then we added 12 to 69 to get 715\n- Finally, we subtracted 3833 from 715 to get 69\nSo our equation is:\n(78 - (57 * (69 - 54))) / (66 - (78 - (57 * (69 - 54))))\nAnd the result is 1, so our equation was correct.

We need to adjust our approach.\nNext, let's try multiplication: 4 * 46 = 184, which is too high. So, we need to adjust it down or use another operation.\nNow, let's add 4 to get closer to 37: 184 + 4 = 188, still too high.\nFinally, let's subtract 4 from 188: 188 - 4 = 184, which is very close to 37. We just need one more adjustment.\nThe correct equation would be: 188 - 19 - 40 + 46 = 37.\nTherefore, the equation equals 37: 188 - 19 - 40 + 46 = 37. <Think > No, let me correct my previous thinking. The correct combination should use all four numbers exactly once. Let me rework it: 40 - 19 = 21, then multiply by 4 to get 84, and finally subtract 46 to reach 37.

One way to approach it is to try different combinations of the numbers and operations until we reach 14.\nWe could start by trying some simple operations like addition or subtraction. But since we want to end up with 14, we might have to combine two or more numbers together.\nAnother approach could be to multiply or divide the numbers. Since we're dealing with larger numbers (like 55), division might give us a result close to 14 if we choose our numbers wisely.\nNow let's think through some possibilities:\nIf we try multiplying 55 and 22, we would get 1210. That's too big!\nIf we try dividing 55 by 22, we get 2.454... which is not an integer.\nThe next logical step would be to add or subtract the numbers in such a way that we get closer to 14 without exceeding it. We can't just add all three numbers together because their sum is already quite high (64).\nA possible solution could involve combining two of the numbers in a way that gives us a reasonable result when added to another number.\nLet's try adding 55 and 22, then dividing by 7:\n(55 + 22) / 7 = 77 / 7 = 11\nThis doesn't give us 14 either.
